Password strength testing software using brute-force cracking
## Short decription
<p>Using a brute-force algorithm, find five-letter passwords that match the following SHA-256 hash values and print them to the screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>1115dd800feaacefdf481f1f9070374a2a81e27880f187396db67958b207cbad</li>
<li>3a7bd3e2360a3d29eea436fcfb7e44c735d117c42d1c1835420b6b9942dd4f1b</li>
<li>74e1bb62f8dabb8125a58852b63bdf6eaef667cb56ac7f7cdba6d7305c50a22f</li>
</ol>
<p>Hash values can be read from a file or directly from the console (forms for entering a hash value).</p>
<p>The program must try all possible passwords consisting of only five lowercase ASCII English letters.</p>
<p>The program must be able to run the enumeration in single-threaded mode or in multi-threaded mode (the number of threads can be set by the user). 
For each mode, it is necessary to display the time spent on the selection. </p>
